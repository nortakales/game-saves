# Pokemon Aurora Ticket Distribution USA GBA Cartridge Rom

[Link](https://digiex.net/threads/pokemon-aurora-ticket-distribution-usa-gba-cartridge-rom-download-usa.14901/)
Filename: `JPAJ - Aurora Ticket (USA).gba` (not in this repo)

## About

This is the distribution cartridge used to distribute the Aurora Ticket, an item which unlocks Birth Island on Pokemon FireRed, LeafGreen and Emerald.
The distribution cartridge distributes the Aurora Ticket as a mystery gift using the GBA Wireless Adaptor to another GBA with a Wireless Adaptor connected. Once the other GBA has received the Aurora Ticket the player can travel to Birth Island to catch Deoxys.

This appears to be the US version of the distribution cartridge which will only distribute to FireRed and LeafGreen, not Emerald like the UK version of the cartridge does.

A massive thanks to Digiex member Deoxyz for purchasing and releasing this distribution cartridge, I know he has personally spent a lot of money on this and wanted nothing in return, expect that others enjoy it all these years later. So be sure to send him the love as without him it you would not have this distribution cartridge.

## Equipment Required:

* 2x GBA's
* 2x GBA Wireless Adaptors
* 1x Distribution Cart (This is what we have the rom of) so you can use a GBA Flash Card or Emulator
* 1x English language Pokemon LeafGreen or FireRed cart (Can be from any English language region)

## Untouched Download Released - 24.12.19:

Since we originally obtained the Pokemon Gen 3 Aurora Ticket Distribution, for several years some private collectors who already possessed the newly public roms said that our version of the Aurora Ticket had a chunk of data erased from the hex. None of this effected the function of usage of the distribution, as it was all miscellaneous and unused data. Not long after we obtained the Doel Deoxys distribution in September 2018, we finally were able to obtain the alleged unedited Aurora Ticket rom. The data that was erased from the public copy before it came into our possession ([further proof GBA devcarts are being rewritten with these](https://digiex.net/threads/how-pokemon-gba-distribution-cartridges-are-replicated-and-sold-for-1000s.15674/)) was revealed to be leftover data of the Japanese Aurora Ticket wondercard and Japanese wonder news about the event. None of this data is usable at the moment, however leftover data in distribution software is commonly found.

Some examples you may remember being Negaiboshi / Wishing Star Jirachi hidden in the Wishmaker software, or the debug/test Pokemon hidden in some of the NDS roms. One day in the future this data may amount for something to be seen or used by the public, but for now the important aspect of this being public is that the original unedited Aurora Ticket Distribution is properly preserved along with all our other unedited [Pokemon Gen 3 GBA Distributions](https://digiex.net/forums/pokemon-gba-event-distributions.151/).


# Pokemon GEN3 Mystery Mew Distribution Save Game

[Link](https://digiex.net/threads/pokemon-gen3-mystery-mew-distribution-save-game-download.14946/)
Filename: `Mystery Mew Save Files.zip`

## About

This download contains multiple Mew Distribution Save Games from the Pokemon GEN 3 Mystery Mew Event.

The Mystery Mew was distributed in Toys "R" Us stores across the United States to commemorate the release of M08: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew.

Nintendo used a standard Pokemon Fire Red game cartridge loaded with boxes of Mystery Mew, which would be traded to people at the event.

This save contains all the individual Mew files that have been obtained, along with the original save files from the distribution event, these have been ripped from multiple different distribution cartridges.

We have also put together a reconstructed save game with 425 of the 426 unique Mystery Mews.

Each save game is credited in the file name, however this is a brief summery:
* Deoxyz
* Twig (3x Saves)
* PPorg - This is a new save released on 29.10.17 with the previously missing Mews, [purchased by a community crowd found on Project Pokemon](https://projectpokemon.org/home/forums/topic/41560-community-outreach-donations-for-very-rare-mystry-mew-cartridge/)
* A reconstructed save with 420 unique Mystery Mews
* A reconstructed save with 425 unique Mystery Mews - this includes the 5x Mews re-created with their proper trashbytes thanks to Ajxpk & @Deoxyz
* Final 426th Mew re created thanks to research by Ajxpk

Below are notes about what was done by the Nintendo employee when they originally played through the game, before they loaded the Mews in and copied it to all the FireRed carts:
* Mewtwo defeated.
* Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres not battled.
* Raikou defeated.
* Western Snorlax defeated.
* Eastern Snorlax not battled.
* Squirtle was starter.
* Rival Name: TORU
* Game appears to have been played through normally by a Nintendo employee.
* All Pokemon in National Pokedex except Celebi. 385 Pokemon.
* Bag is empty of all sellable/tossable items. Only Key Items and HMs remain.

# 10ANNIV Distribution Cartridge

Filename: `BUUJ - Top 10 (ENG).gba` (not in this repo)

This is the best/only way to get legit Lugia and Ho-oh. Also much easier to get legendary dogs than a complete play through for FR/LG.

## About

[Link](https://digiex.net/threads/pokemon-10anniv-distribution-cartridge-gba-download-eng-fre-ger-ita-spa.14897/)

This is the distribution cartridge used for the Pokemon 10ANNIV event distributions in the United Kingdom, then later other European counties. These Pokemon were distributed for a limited time back in 2006 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Pokemon.

With this you can send a legit 10ANNIV Charizard, Pikachu, Articuno, Raikou, Entei, Suicune, Lugia, Ho-oh, Latias and Latios to your Pokemon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, LeafGreen or FireRed GBA Games.

## Procedure:

1. Save in a Pokemon center and have at least 1 free slot in your party
2. Now turn off the receiving system.
3. Turn on the sending system with the distribution cart inside, connect with a link cable to the receiving system with the Pokemon 3rd gen cart inside and select the Pokemon to transfer.
4. Turn on the receiving system WITHOUT any cart inside, or hold start and select as you power the receiving system on, leaving the cartridge in
5. After a couple seconds you’ll see a colored Nintendo logo appearing on the receiving system. When you see it, put the Pokemon 3rd gen cart inside the receiving system. If you held start and select keeping the cartridge in, the distribution process will simply happen.
6. You’ll see a screen that tells you a Pokemon is being received. That Pokemon will be in your party.

## Troubleshooting:

* Ensure you are using an a Pokemon game that matches the language of the distribution you are using, for example the English distribution and an English Pokemon game. It is not possible to mix and match different languages, however you can trade the Pokemon to a different language game once distributed.

* You are following the procedure perfectly (receiving cart first not inserted, then inserted when Nintendo logo appears)

* Have saved in a Pokemon center and have at least a free slot in the party

* If the transfer gives you an error, try changing the link cable ( some 3rd cables don’t work), the gba systems or the receiving cart ( unofficial carts could not work).

* It the cart suddenly doesn’t transfer Pokemon anymore then just turn both the systems off and on again.

# Event Pokemon Save Files

Pokemon: Celebi
[Link](https://digiex.net/threads/pokemon-gen3-legit-event-pokemon-save-ruby-sapphire-emerald-firered-leafgreen.14690/)


## About

This is a Pokemon FireRed savefile which contains a compilation of legit event Pokemon for the Generation 3 games (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed & LeafGreen).

The GEN3 Pokemon games had a lot of events, many of which are extremely hard to obtain today. I'm making this post with the hope it encourages others to share event Pokemon they may have gathered many years ago. Pokemon GEN3 games predate any sort of internet trading, and the event Pokemon from this generation have often been migrated up to newer Pokemon games. These factors make it quite hard to find legitimate event Pokemon for GEN3. The only way we can expect to obtain more event Pokemon for GEN3 is if others share their save/pk3 files, which I'm hoping this post will encourage you to do if you happen to have some!

## The main savefile contains the following event Pokemon in each box:

### Box 1 & 2: 10th Anniversary (Europe, Top 10 Distribution) + Aura Mew

The OT for each language is as follows: 10ANNIV (ENG), 10JAHRE (GER), 10ANNIV (FRE), 10ANNI (ITA), 10ANIV (SPA)
These Pokemon were selected through a poll and later distributed at various locations in 2006 for the "Top 10" event throughout Europe to celebrate 10 years of Pokemon.

We also have a full set of Aura Mew distributions from Europe, each in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. OT is the same for each language.

## The extra savefiles contain the following event Pokemon in each box:

The extra savefiles provided contain overflow of the existing event pokemon from the main savefile.

Most overflow of each Japanese event are included here, the only exception being the hundreds of event Pikachu. So if you want the full compilation of overflow Japanese events, please see this thread: [Pokemon GEN3 Legit JPN Event Pokemon .pk3 Downloads](https://digiex.net/threads/pokemon-gen3-legit-jpn-event-pokemon-pk3-downloads-ruby-sapphire-emerald-firered-leafgreen.15268/)
